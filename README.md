# Fisheries
A fully reproducible GitHub repository containing suitably named sub-folders, data files (if small) and the R scriptsUsing data from a 3rd year course that may be similar to the data for my potential honours project.

The dataset is from a 3rd year project for BIO3017S.
The project aimed to investigate the biology of the two seabream species from the Western Cape: Pachymetopon blochii and Spondyliosoma emarginatum. Data on catch date, sex (M/F), length (Total Length and Fork Length) (mm), mass(g), Gonad Weight (g), fat (0-3) and Gonad Stages (1-7) are available for both species, but for this deliverable, I focused only on the P. blochii dataset.

GSI and Le Cren's condition index were calculated using the recorded data. The equations for these are further down.
